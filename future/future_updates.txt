[CRITICAL] SCHOOL SETTINGS & DATA INTEGRITY POLICY
---------------------------------------------------
DATE: 2025-12-29
MODULE: Settings & Configuration
BRAND: Greyway.Co / Fees Up

1. ONLINE-ONLY CONSTRAINT
   - Modifications to "School Details", "Billing Configurations", and "Tax Rates" 
     are STRICTLY RESTRICTED to Online Mode.
   - REASON: These are "Source of Truth" configurations. Sync conflicts here 
     could corrupt financial calculations for all students.
   - IMPLEMENTATION: The 'Save' buttons must be disabled if 
     `DatabaseService.isConnected` is false.

2. LIABILITY & DATA RECOVERY
   - ACTIONS ARE PERMANENT. There is NO "Undo" feature for configuration changes.
   - Greyway.Co and its subsidiaries (including "Fees Up") explicitly disclaim 
     responsibility for data erasure, corruption, or financial discrepancies 
     resulting from user misconfiguration.
   - We do not offer data recovery services for "School Year" deletions or 
     "Billing Cycle" resets initiated by the user.

3. TERMS OF SERVICE (REAL-TIME EXECUTION)
   - By clicking "Save Changes" on the Settings screen, the user acknowledges:
     a) They are authorized to make financial changes.
     b) The changes apply immediately to the Server (Postgres).
     c) They accept full liability for the accuracy of tax rates and fees.

4. UI REQUIREMENT
   - A visible "Warning: No Undo" badge must appear near the Save button.
   - The "Terms of Service" link must be accessible on this screen.
