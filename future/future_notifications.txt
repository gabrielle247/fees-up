[FUTURE] SERVER-SIDE NOTIFICATION AUTOMATION BOT
---------------------------------------------------
DATE: 2025-12-29
MODULE: Notifications & Announcements
BRAND: Greyway.Co / Fees Up

1. THE "WATCHDOG" BOT STRATEGY
   - We will deploy a server-side "Watchdog" process (Node.js/Python) that runs 
     independently of user sessions.
   - Triggers:
     a) Database Events (Postgres Triggers via Supabase).
     b) Scheduled Cron Jobs (Daily at 08:00 AM, Monthly 1st).

2. AUTOMATED ANNOUNCEMENT GENERATION
   - The bot will automatically insert records into the `announcements` table 
     based on system health and financial thresholds.
   - Example Scenarios:
     * "Server Load High": If API latency > 500ms for 5 mins.
     * "Monthly Ledger Ready": On the 1st of the month, auto-generate PDF and 
       post a "Financial" announcement with the download link.
     * "Low Attendance": If daily attendance < 80%, post an "Academic" alert.

3. SMART ROUTING
   - Critical Alerts (Red): Pushed via FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) immediately 
     to all Admin devices.
   - Warnings (Yellow): Email summary at end of day.
   - Info (Blue/Grey): In-app badge increment only.

4. REQUIRED BACKEND INFRASTRUCTURE
   - `system_health_logs` table.
   - `announcement_rules` table (to configure thresholds).
