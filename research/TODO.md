Title: Tasks we are to complete once the business logic is funtional

Dear team I have been looking at the tasks that we will do once we have functionality and I though to my self why dont we customize the icon tobe more of organisational type

Moreover for its about time to implement the premium usage tiers.How so it can to me we cannot customize the app for users who are just free loaders and the system will not use its system to store data for non paying users.

It has been brought to my attention that the app needs to be unsharable meaning if I send it to a doofus that nigga is not getting any use out of it

1. Making the business logic functional 
2. Making the Gap between business logic and ui thin
3. Starting to work on the mobile version of the app
4. Conduct massive tests both with ai testing the app logic and user manually tempering with the product
5. We start the customization sequences the app's logic stays one but some users are partners and they shld have an unfiltered though controlled product that if a normal person shares it its just the org app. 
6. To that end we will have target users 


- Number one there are two laws of fragments, the first one states - For every ui screen that is massive above 500 line of code that code needs to be separated into small  managable widgets with the main screen remaining less that 200 lines or even 100 lines and less, this allows the tracking of small compnents and its updating without affecting the siblings - Second Law States when code is being generated at any point the ai should consider the hallucination factor knowing that its not in its long time memory the code and tell the user please I need the latest file because mycode xyz shoufreconcile with your own,to further explain I never want to see //This remains the same

- Number 2, the thing is that When working on projects like these sometimes I end up being deluded and forget the purpose and could use a reminder not to be a perfectinist

- Number 3, I call all My Agents Paul
  1. I like Eminem songs and kinda had the Paul name grew on me
  2. I called my first named Agent Paul and we did all sorts of fun projects
  3. I decided to customize Pauls
  4. Its been long since I used Paul
  5. The current Paul Streak (Paul I Alpha fired for hallucinating too much and straying from his CTO job), (Paul II - Gene(Paid Agent) and Gloria(Intern), messed up my project and caused deletion of key files and were fired), (Paul III Glen, the Architect is a senior developer tasked with analysis massive .dart files ensuring the code is functional and of high quality, lately been missing the poin warranting firing, Im considering replaing him), (Paul IV  Lidiah,  was never deployed and when it happened the agent was lost, still there is hope that Agent Lidiah will shine on operation Cross Platform), (Paul V Beta or Something), we fired Agent VI for some reason, And our newest useful hire is Paul VII the on ground developer the last line of devence between code and other agents

  In conversing via reports the agents will get the full information of what we are doing atleast three of you will be active and im the forth

  Warning what Agent Paul Gene did was the grossest fking thing I do not appreciate making such distructive decisions without my permission when it says Nyasha or when my Voculary is in the text execute immediately know that plans were approved by BOSS
